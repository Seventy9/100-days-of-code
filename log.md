# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 12th, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Signed up to Frontend Masters and started watching the free bootcamp introduction to HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

**Thoughts** I have only recently started studying web development, starting with Angela Yu's "The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp" course on Udemy.  After an intense first week, I am reasonably confident with my HTML and CSS knowledge, but I felt like I needed more JavaScript training so I signed up to Frontend Masters after finding out about them on Twitter.

### Day 1: July 13th, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Watched more Frontend Masters Bootcamp, started working on "Advent of Code".

**Thoughts** I completed the first half of the first "Advent of Code" puzzle with ease, the second half is a bit more challenging.  It requires a bit more thought.  Frontend Masters Bootcamp progress is on to JS now, I need more exposure to it.

### Day 2: July 20th, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the "Responsive Web Design" course on freeCodeCamp and finished the 1st of 5 projects.

**Thoughts** As I had already learned HTML and CSS from the Udemy course "The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp", I moved swiftly through all the lessons of "Responsive Web Design" completing all tests with relative ease. However, the first project, copying the Tribute Page, took quite a while as I wrote it from scratch and made a few errors along the way regarding the layout, but in the end they were easily fixed. It's not perfect, but it passed all the tests.

### Day 3: July 21st, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the 2nd of 5 projects on the "Responsive Web Design" course with freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** Getting the HTML written up for this was very quick and easy, took about half an hour. The next couple of hours were spent playing with CSS to get it looking how I wanted. I still have a few issues that I will spend some time to ask around and investigate to see how to fix them, but overall I am very happy with the way it turned out. The CSS can use some serious refactoring, I am aware, but for right now, typing the same code over and over is an assistant to learning for me. I know it can be done better and more streamlined, so I don't believe this is me learning bad habits early on.

### Day 4: July 23rd, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Started the 3rd of 5 projects on the "Responsive Web Design" course with freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** Working on the 3rd challenge of "Responsive Web Design" and I am struggling. I am trying my best to write the page with my own CSS rather than relying on Bootstrap, however, if I were to use Bootstrap I would've finished by now. I would rather know how to do it myself properly rather than rely on a framework though. Most of the site looks OK so far, I am just struggling with the flex boxes and the responsiveness of the features and pricing sections so they change layout depending on page width.

### Day 5: July 24th, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the 3rd of 5 projects on the "Responsive Web Design" course with freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** Finally completed the 3rd project on "Responsive Web Design" course with freeCodeCamp. This one took a lot longer as I had to ensure the page was responsive in all areas (navbar, features list, videos and pricing boxes) for mobile and desktop designs. This was very challenging for me as I refused to use Bootstrap in order to try and learn more about the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. I think the end result came out reasonably well.

### Day 6: July 25th, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the 4th of 5 projects on the "Responsive Web Design" course with freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I finished this project a lot quicker than others and had very few problems with working on either the layout using flexboxes or responsiveness using media queries. I think I am getting a much better grasp on this now. I started late in the day due to sleep issues, so this update comes on Sunday but is actually for Saturday.

### Day 7: July 26th, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the last project on the "Responsive Web Design" course with freeCodeCamp and earned a certificate.

**Thoughts** I realised today that all the struggling I had been doing trying to get "cards" working properly on a website was a failing in my abililty to understand the difference between flexboxes and grids. Having figured this out, I managed to refactor project 5 a little to get it working, but from now on, I will know better and will start working on them correctly from the start. Having completed the first course "Responsive Web Design" with freeCodeCamp I now feel suitably able to build my own responsive and well laid out portfolio site with a few bells and whistles.

### Day 8: July 27th, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started working on my portfolio site.

**Thoughts** Took a little break from studying today, it's been a busy few days what with completing the "Responsive Web Design" course with freeCodeCamp. It's barebones at the moment, so not live, just working on layout, colours and styles. I actually have nothing of worth to put on a portfolio yet, but there's no reason why I can't get the site written up ready for me to fill out at a later date.

### Day 9: July 28th, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the first draft of my portfolio site and uploaded it to GitHub.

**Thoughts** Continued and completed the first draft of my portfolio site. Very basic for now, a little information, contact details, links etc... missing Projects as I have nothing of worth to add just yet. I still can't figure out the scaling completely, on a mobile device the size of the navbar is too small and the contact links are small too. Other than that, it looks OK to me.

### Day 10: July 29th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Resolved the scaling issue on my portfolio site.

**Thoughts** It turns out that not using a meta tag in your HTML head to set the viewport initial scale to one makes your website not work properly on mobile devices. Once I fixed that, I refactored almost the entire CSS code on my site to fix all the scaling issues. I also change some of the layout to improve it's looks.

### Day 11: July 31st, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Almost completed "Basic JavaScript" section on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** Learnt about JavaScript basics today, including loops, variables, arrays, multi-dimension arrays, etc. Struggled with a couple of the challenges, but after a short break I was able to return and complete them by spotting the mistakes.

### Day 12: August 1st, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Finished off "Basic JavaScript" section on freeCodeCamp and completed "ES6" section.

**Thoughts** Had a few hurdles with the Basic Javascript section, but after short breaks I was able to resolve the issues almost immediately. I think this goes to show my understanding was fine, I was just getting tunnel vision. The ES6 section however was pretty overwhelming, and although I passed all the challenges I certainly do not feel as though I understood everything properly. I may have to revisit this section.

### Day 13: August 2nd, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Struggled through the Regular Expressions section and breezed through the Debugging section of "JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures" on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** Struggled my way through the RegEx section of JavaScript on freeCodeCamp, but eventually got through. The biggest hurdle was overcome by again, take a break for an hour to eat and watch something and coming back to it. I like this way of dealing with problems when I'm learning now! The debugging section was actually very easy in comparison, mostly because I have a pretty good eve for detail and could spot the mistakes before even reading the question advising where to look.

### Day 14: August 12th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the "Basic Algorithm Scripting" section on freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts** This was an interesting section, utilising whatever skills learnt in the previous JavaScript sections to achieve the required outcome. Whilst I understood the challenges in my head immediately upon reading them, getting to the required output on some took 1-2 hours, mainly due to minor misunderstandings or typos. Some of them I completed very quickly. I think my understanding of JavaScript is much better now and I look forward to continuing "The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp" on Udemy.
