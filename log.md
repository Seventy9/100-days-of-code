# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 12th, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Signed up to Frontend Masters and started watching the free bootcamp introduction to HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

**Thoughts** I have only recently started studying web development, starting with Angela Yu's "The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp" course on Udemy.  After an intense first week, I am reasonably confident with my HTML and CSS knowledge, but I felt like I needed more JavaScript training so I signed up to Frontend Masters after finding out about them on Twitter.
