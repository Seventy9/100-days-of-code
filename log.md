# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 12th, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Signed up to Frontend Masters and started watching the free bootcamp introduction to HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

**Thoughts** I have only recently started studying web development, starting with Angela Yu's "The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp" course on Udemy.  After an intense first week, I am reasonably confident with my HTML and CSS knowledge, but I felt like I needed more JavaScript training so I signed up to Frontend Masters after finding out about them on Twitter.

### Day 1: July 13th, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Watched more Frontend Masters Bootcamp, started working on "Advent of Code".

**Thoughts** I completed the first half of the first "Advent of Code" puzzle with ease, the second half is a bit more challenging.  It requires a bit more thought.  Frontend Masters Bootcamp progress is on to JS now, I need more exposure to it.

### Day 2: July 20th, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed "Responsive Web Design" course on freeCodeCamp and finished the 1st of 5 projects.

**Thoughts** As I had already learned HTML and CSS from the Udemy course "The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp", I moved swiftly through all the lessons of "Responsive Web Design" completing all tests with relative ease. However, the first project, copying the Tribute Page, took quite a while as I wrote it from scratch and made a few errors along the way regarding the layout, but in the end they were easily fixed. It's not perfect, but it passed all the tests.
