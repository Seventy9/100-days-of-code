# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 12th, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Signed up to Frontend Masters and started watching the free bootcamp introduction to HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

**Thoughts** I have only recently started studying web development, starting with Angela Yu's "The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp" course on Udemy.  After an intense first week, I am reasonably confident with my HTML and CSS knowledge, but I felt like I needed more JavaScript training so I signed up to Frontend Masters after finding out about them on Twitter.

### Day 1: July 13th, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Watched more Frontend Masters Bootcamp, started working on "Advent of Code".

**Thoughts** I completed the first half of the first "Advent of Code" puzzle with ease, the second half is a bit more challenging.  It requires a bit more thought.  Frontend Masters Bootcamp progress is on to JS now, I need more exposure to it.

### Day 2: July 20th, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed "Responsive Web Design" course on freeCodeCamp and finished the 1st of 5 projects.

**Thoughts** As I had already learned HTML and CSS from the Udemy course "The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp", I moved swiftly through all the lessons of "Responsive Web Design" completing all tests with relative ease. However, the first project, copying the Tribute Page, took quite a while as I wrote it from scratch and made a few errors along the way regarding the layout, but in the end they were easily fixed. It's not perfect, but it passed all the tests.

### Day 3: July 21st, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 2nd of 5 projects on "Responsive Web Design" course with freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** Getting the HTML written up for this was very quick and easy, took about half an hour. The next couple of hours were spent playing with CSS to get it looking how I wanted. I still have a few issues that I will spend some time to ask around and investigate to see how to fix them, but overall I am very happy with the way it turned out. The CSS can use some serious refactoring, I am aware, but for right now, typing the same code over and over is an assistant to learning for me. I know it can be done better and more streamlined, so I don't believe this is me learning bad habits early on.
